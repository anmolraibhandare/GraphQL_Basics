# GraphQL
**Prerequisite:** 
- Install, configure and init an Amplify project with Amplify CLI
- Define a GraphQL schema that we can use to provision backend resources, store data locally, sync to a cloud database, as well as receive updates over a realtime 
subscription.

**Output** \
Learn how to deploy an AWS AppSync GraphQL API and connect to it from a client application. The Amplify API category provides an interface for retrieving and persisting your model data. The API category comes with default built-in support for AWS AppSync. The Amplify CLI allows you to define your API and provision a GraphQL service with CRUD operations and real-time functionality.

### GraphQL?
`GraphQL` is a data language that was developed to enable apps to fetch data from APIs. It has a declarative, self-documenting style. In a GraphQL operation, the client specifies how to structure the data when it is returned by the server. This makes it possible for the client to query only for the data it needs, in the format that it needs it in.
